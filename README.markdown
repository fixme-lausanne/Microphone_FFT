# Microphone_FFT

This 2 part project shows how to use a microphone with an Arduino board and display an audio spectrum with Processing.

List of parts:
- Arduino (Uno for me)
- Microphone (I use this one: <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9964>)
- Breadboard

Arduino Fixed point FFT library is from ELM Chan, <http://elm-chan.org/works/akilcd/report_e.html>
Processing code is based on: <http://boolscott.wordpress.com/2010/02/04/arduino-processing-analogue-bar-graph-2/>
